# Password Generator
The Password Generator is a Python script designed to create a secure and random password based on user-defined criteria. The program prompts the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to include in the password. After generating a preliminary password with the specified components, it shuffles the characters to further randomize the order, enhancing password security. This tool is ideal for anyone looking for a quick way to create strong passwords tailored to their needs.

## Features
